For instance\r\n```\r\nLambda\r\n  X\r\n  X\r\n```\r\nis equivalent to\r\n```\r\nLambda\r\n  X\r\n  And\r\n    X\r\n    X\r\n```\r\n(recall that And is used as a clause conjunction by the pattern matcher, not a literal `AndLink`.\r\n\r\n## Requirement\r\n\r\nThe reduct engine must be ported to atomese.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nLet us recall how the pattern miner works\r\n1. Select pattern P from pattern pool\r\n2. Calculate shallow abstractions of P\r\n3. Generate specializations of P by composing it with its shallow abstractions\r\n4. Insert specializations with enough support back in the pattern pool\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid over-representation, before inserting new patterns back in the pattern pool, the pattern miner should have an extra step, say between step 3. and step 4., if reduction is done over all specializations, or after step 4., if reduction is done only over specializations with enough support."}]
